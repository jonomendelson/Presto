# Presto

Used Ionic, Google Firebase, Stripe API to build an iOS app in 2018 that allows users to order food from their seats in restaurants, saving waiters’ time. At its peak, Presto was active in over 20 restaurants with $2,500+ in orders a month. An investor from the Founder’s Bootcamp selected Presto to receive up to $50,000 of funding to incorporate and cover all other expenses.
